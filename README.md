# Blog Management System

My first ever MERN stack project. This a personal blog application built with React and React Router for client-side routing. It allows users to view, manage, and search for blog content.

## Features

- **Client-side Routing:** Utilizes React Router for dynamic navigation between different pages without full page reloads.
- **Blog Selection:** Browse different blog categories such as fitness, family, reflection, and food.
- **Read Blogs:** View detailed content for each blog category with dynamic routing based on the selected article.
- **Manage Blogs:** Administrators can view blog content, and add blog posts.
- **Word Search:** Users can search for the definition of words using an integrated dictionary API.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** A routing library for React that enables dynamic routing in single-page applications.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
